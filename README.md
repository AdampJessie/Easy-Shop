# Digital Emporium

## Description of the Project

Welcome to the Easy Shop! This program reads and updates an SQL database and is a web application ran on the local machine.
These products populate the store, where users can filter available products by category/color/price, and place them in a virtual cart!
Users can create register profiles to access the virtual cart, admins alone have privileges to update and delete data.


## User Stories

-As a user, I'd like to filter by color/price/category from a large selection of products to find 
my desired product hassle-free.

-As a user, I'd like to register a profile to save my cart, orders, and access the site on 
a personal basis.

-As a user, I'd like to update my profile so that I can update important information such as my 
shipping address or phone number.

-As an owner, I'd like to restrict editing and deleting data to administrators so that I can avoid 
malicious actors vandalizing my virtual shop.

-As a user, I'd like some of the bugs fixed, so that I can use the website as intended.

-As an owner, I'd like to keep track of my orders so that I can deliver products on a mass scale as my shop grows.
